"Understanding Numeric Data Types in Python: Integers, Floats, and Their Properties"

### Python Numeric Data Types

In Python, numeric data types include `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `complex`. Let’s explore each of these data types in detail.

#### 1. Integer (`int`)
An integer in Python is a numeric value without a decimal point. For example, `125` and `2164` are integers because they have no decimal points. You can store these values in variables like this:

```python
a = 125
b = 2164
```

You can also have negative integers, such as `-17`. Python’s integer type allows both positive and negative numbers. One significant feature of integers in Python is that there is no fixed size limit. You can store very large numbers without worrying about memory constraints.

For example:

```python
x = 125973
```

This number can be stored without any issue, regardless of its length. In contrast to other programming languages like C, C++, and Java, where integers have a fixed size (usually 4 bytes), Python’s `int` type dynamically adjusts based on the size of the number. The memory consumed by an integer in Python depends on the number's size.

You can check the memory size of an integer using the `__sizeof__()` method:

```python
print(x.__sizeof__())  # Output: Memory size in bytes
```

For example, a small integer might take 28 bytes, while a larger one might take 40 bytes.

Another important aspect is that Python’s integers are immutable. If you assign a new value to an existing variable, Python creates a new object in memory rather than modifying the existing one.

For example:

```python
a = 125
a = 200
```

Here, Python doesn’t modify the value `125` but creates a new object with the value `200`. This immutability ensures that the original value remains unchanged.

#### 2. Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)
A floating-point number is a numeric value that includes a decimal point, such as `13.25`. Python supports both positive and negative floating-point numbers:

```python
a = 13.25
b = -17.66
```

In addition to standard decimal notation, floating-point numbers can also be represented in scientific notation. For example, the number `12.59` can be represented as `1.259E1` (where `E` denotes "times ten raised to the power of"). This representation is particularly useful for very large or very small numbers.

For instance:

```python
c = 1259E-2  # Equivalent to 12.59
```

Similar to integers, Python’s floating-point numbers have no fixed size limit, and they are also immutable.

You can check the memory size of a float using the `__sizeof__()` method:

```python
x = 123456789.123456789
print(x.__sizeof__())  # Output: Memory size in bytes
```

#### 3. Boolean (`bool`)
A boolean data type can have one of two possible values: `True` or `False`. Booleans are often used in conditional statements and expressions to control the flow of the program. For example:

```python
is_active = True
is_admin = False
```

In Python, booleans are a subclass of integers, where `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`.

#### 4. Complex Numbers (`complex`)
Python also supports complex numbers, which are used in scientific and engineering applications. A complex number is represented by `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part. For example:

```python
z = 3 + 4j
```

Here, `3` is the real part, and `4j` is the imaginary part.

### Summary
In summary, Python’s numeric data types provide a lot of flexibility and power. You can work with integers, floats, booleans, and complex numbers without worrying about size limitations. Python handles memory management efficiently and ensures that the values remain immutable, leading to more reliable and predictable code behavior.

Next, we’ll explore boolean and complex data types in more detail.
