**Title:** Understanding Data Types in Python

### Python Types

In Python, variables are references to data, and the type of data they hold can change dynamically, making Python a dynamically typed language. This means that you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly; it is automatically inferred based on the value assigned to it.

For example, consider the variable `x`:

```python
x = 25
```

Here, the value `25` is an integer, so Python automatically treats `x` as an integer. If you later assign a different type of value to `x`, the type of `x` will change accordingly:

```python
x = 13.75  # Now x is a float
x = "A"    # Now x is a string
```

In Python, everything is an object, meaning every value has a type, and that type is determined by the class it belongs to. For instance, when you assign an integer to `x`, Python internally treats `x` as an instance of the `int` class.

You can check the type of any variable using the `type()` function:

```python
x = 25
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

x = 13.75
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'float'>

x = "A"
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

Moreover, Python supports a variety of data types, such as:

- **Integers (`int`)**: Whole numbers, e.g., `25`.
- **Floating-point numbers (`float`)**: Numbers with a decimal point, e.g., `13.75`.
- **Strings (`str`)**: A sequence of characters, e.g., `"A"`.
- **Lists (`list`)**: A collection of values, e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

These types are just a few examples, and Python offers many more. The key takeaway is that in Python, the type of a variable is determined by the value it holds, and this type can change as the value changes.
