Absolutely, setting up Python and a code editor on Windows is a great way to kickstart your programming journey. Here are step-by-step instructions:

### Step 1: Install Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Click on the "Downloads" tab.
   - Choose the latest version of Python 3.x for your Windows operating system.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Once the download is complete, run the installer.
   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" to make it easier to run Python from the command line.
   - Click "Install Now" to start the installation.

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open the Windows Command Prompt (you can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu).
   - Type `python --version` or `python -V` and press Enter. This should display the installed Python version.

### Step 2: Install a Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)

1. **Download Visual Studio Code:**
   - Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - Click on the "Download for Windows" button.

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Once the download is complete, run the installer.
   - Follow the installation prompts, and leave the default options selected.

3. **Launch Visual Studio Code:**
   - After installation, you can launch Visual Studio Code from the Start menu or by searching for "Visual Studio Code."

### Step 3: Create a Simple Python Script

1. **Open Visual Studio Code:**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code.

2. **Create a New File:**
   - Click on "File" in the top-left corner and choose "New File" (or press `Ctrl + N`).

3. **Write Python Code:**
   - Copy the sample Python code provided earlier for the simple calculator.
   - Paste the code into your new file.

4. **Save the File:**
   - Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `calculator.py`. Save it in a location where you can easily access it.

### Step 4: Run Python Script in Visual Studio Code

1. **Open the Terminal in Visual Studio Code:**
   - In Visual Studio Code, click on "View" in the top menu, then select "Terminal" (or press `Ctrl + `).
   - This will open the integrated terminal at the bottom of the window.

2. **Navigate to the Script's Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is saved. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\script
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Type the following command and press Enter to run the script:
     ```bash
     python calculator.py
     ```
     If you're using Python 3, the command might be `python3` instead of `python`:
     ```bash
     python3 calculator.py
     ```

4. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - The script will prompt you to enter two numbers and choose an operation. Follow the prompts and press Enter.

5. **View the Result:**
   - The script will perform the calculation based on your input and display the result.

Congratulations! You've now installed Python, set up a code editor (Visual Studio Code), and run a simple Python script. This foundation will serve you well as you continue your programming journey. Feel free to explore more projects and enjoy coding!
