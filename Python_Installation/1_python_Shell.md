Setting Up Python and IDs: A Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Installing Python**:
   - Open your web browser and search for "download Python".
   - Click on the first link from Python.org, the official website.
   - Download Python by clicking on the appropriate button for your operating system.
   - For Windows, make sure to select "Add Python.exe to path" during installation.
   - Once downloaded, double click the installer and follow the prompts to install Python.
   - Python will be installed on your machine, and you'll find it in the Start Menu under "Python".



2. **Using Python Shell**:
   - Python Shell is a playground where you can execute Python statements and see instant results.
   - It's not for writing complete programs but for testing and practicing Python statements.
   - Example commands:
     ```python
     print("hello")
     x = 10
     y = 15
     print(x + y)
     ```

3. **Checking Python Version**:
   - To check the installed Python version, use the command:
     ```
     python --version
     ```

4. **Using IDLE**:
   - IDLE is similar to Python Shell but allows writing and running small Python programs.
   - It's useful for demonstrating and explaining Python concepts.
   - You can create, edit, and run Python scripts in IDLE.
   - Example script:
     ```python
     length = 15
     breadth = 20
     area = length * breadth
     print("Area is", area)
     ```

5. **Saving Python Programs**:
   - In IDLE, you can save Python programs as `.py` files.
   - Choose a location to save your program, preferably in a dedicated folder.
   - Example: Save the program as `first.py`.

6. **Running Python Programs in IDLE**:
   - After saving the program, you can run it from IDLE.
   - Use the "Run" option to execute the script.
   - Example: Running the saved program to calculate the area of a rectangle.

7. **Additional IDs**:
   - Jupyter Notebook is another popular environment for Python development.
   - It allows combining code, visualizations, and explanatory text in a single document.
   - Installation instructions for Jupyter Notebook can be provided in subsequent tutorials.

By following these steps, you can set up Python on your machine, explore its features using Python Shell and IDLE, and start writing and executing Python programs.
