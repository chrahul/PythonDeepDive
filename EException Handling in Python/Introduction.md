## Lesson: Exception Handling in Python

Welcome to this section on exception handling in Python. Exceptions are a crucial concept in programming, often referred to as runtime errors. Unlike syntax errors that prevent your code from running, exceptions occur during the execution of your program and can cause it to crash if not properly managed.

In this lesson, we'll dive into the world of exceptions—what they are, why they occur, and how you can effectively handle them to ensure your programs run smoothly. Whether you're new to programming or have some experience, this topic will equip you with essential skills to manage unexpected issues in your code.

We'll start with a clear introduction to exceptions, followed by practical demonstrations that will help you understand how to handle them effectively. The goal is to make your programs more robust and error-resistant.

Since this might be a new concept for many of you, the material is designed with beginners in mind. You'll find step-by-step explanations and demonstrations, making it easy to grasp and apply these concepts.

As you progress through the lesson, be sure to complete the hands-on demonstrations and challenges provided. Exception handling is a standalone topic, so it’s not directly related to the previous lessons—consider it a fresh and important concept to add to your programming toolkit.
